TestMickey
This program uses the shape instructions we made to draw a Mickey mouse head.
Only circles will be used. The applet will contain the black mouse silhouette
and have a line for each of the circles describing the shape, center, and 
radius. If it does not run properly, the words "An Exception Occured! Check 
the terminal window for details!" will appear in red on the applet. In these 
cases, the silhouette may be drawn partially or not at all. 

TestHouseWithDelays
This program uses multiple instructions for shapes to draw a green house. 
The house is made of rectangles (the body, chimney, and door), squares
(windows), lines(window panes), triangles(roof), and a circle (doorknob). 
Below the house will be individual descriptions of each instance of a shape, 
detailing the coordinates or sizes of the shape.  If it doesn't run properly 
an error message will appear on the screen.
