TestMickey
This program uses the shape instructions we made to draw a Mickey mouse head.
Only circles will be used. The applet will contain the black mouse silhouette
and have a line for each of the circles describing the shape, center, and 
radius. If it does not run properly, the words "An Exception Occured! Check 
the terminal window for details!" will appear in red on the applet. In these 
cases, the silhouette may be drawn partially or not at all. 

TestHouseWithDelays
This program uses multiple instructions for shapes to draw a green house. 
The body of the house is made of a rectangle filled with green. The chimney 
is a rectangle filled with red. The door is a rectangle filled with yellow. 
The left window is a square and the right window is a copy of the left. 
The window panes are made of lines, and the roof is a triangle filled with 
green. Triangles are made with 3 lines. The doorknob is a circle.
Below the house will be individual descriptions of each instance of a shape, 
detailing the coordinates or sizes of the shape. If it doesn't run properly 
an error message will appear on the screen.

1. You can test by calling exception if 
line1.getStart()==line2.getStart() || line2.getStart()==line2.getEnd()
The == checks if the start and end points of the 2 lines are in the same 
memory location. If they are in the same memory location, you made a 
shallow copy.

2. Test by calling exception if
line1.getStart()==line2.getStart() || line1.getStart()==line2.getEnd() 
|| point1.getX() == point2.getX() || point1.getY() == point2.getY()     
The == checks if the points' X's and Y's and the start and end points of 
the 2 lines are in the same memory location. If they are in the same memory
location, you made a shallow copy.
