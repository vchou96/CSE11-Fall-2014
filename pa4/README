ResizablePacMan
This program will provide the PacMan information necessary to run 
ResizablePacManController and will not show anything on its own. It provides
the information on how to create a PacMan (with the center at the place the
mouse clicks), how it will grow and shrink, what color it would be (depending
on the quadrant), and how it spins (counterclockwise). 

ResizablePacManController
This program will use the PacMen information provided by ResizablePacMan to 
actually open the applet and put the PacMen on the canvas. When you run the 
program, two lines (one vertical, one horizontal) will appear through the 
middle of the canvas. You can press on either line (or both at the same time)
and drag it around, but you cannot pass a 5-pixel border on each of the four
edges of the canvas. Changing the size of the canvas will make the lines move
in proportion as well so they will adjust to the size of the canvas while
keeping the four quadrants proportional. When you click on the canvas, a 
PacMan will appear. THe PacMan will be cyan if it is in Quadrant 1, magenta 
if it is in Quadrant 2, yellow if Quadrant 3, and black in Quadrant 4. Each 
PacMan created will spin counterclockwise and alternate between growing and 
shrinking. Having the mouse exit the canvas will not do anything to the applet.

1. cp ../../../fubar.java .
2. The command shows the manual for concatenation.
3. Type rm -f ~/*.html
4. Typing "G" jumps to the end of the file.
5. :q means to quit (will not work if changes were made to file without 
saving) while :q! means to quit without writing.
6. A constructor signature must have the access modifier (private, public) 
and the name of the class. 
7. Overloading is when methods have the same name but different parameters.
