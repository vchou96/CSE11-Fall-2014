This program will build upon the ResizablePacMan/ResizablePacManController
programs and add buttons and sliders for the user to manipulate different
features of the Pacman. When the applet is first opened, the program will 
have the horizontal and vertical lines centered at the middle of the canvas.
Clicking on the canvas will create a PacMan, and its color depends on the 
quadrant it is in relative to the lines (1st quadrant is cyan, 2nd quadrant 
is magenta, 3rd quadrant is yellow, 4th quadrant is black. The lines can be 
dragged with the mouse to change the quadrants the PacMen are in and 
therefore their colors. Whenever the PacMen are created, they will already 
start spinning clockwise and resizing themselves like the previous 
ResizablePacMan/ResizablePacManController programs. However, this time there
will be two additional panels on the applet: one across the top and one 
across the bottom.  In addition, the PacMen are no longer stationary and can
 be dragged around (also with the lines at the same time). 

The top panel is named "Resizable PacMen Controls" and 
contains three buttons: the "Start", "Stop", and "Clear All" buttons. The 
"Start" button will start the process of PacMen resizing (grow and shrink) 
and spinning clockwise while the "Stop" button will make all the PacMen 
freeze. The "Clear All" button will make all the PacMen created disappear 
and leave only the lines. After a button is clicked once, clicking on it 
again will have no visible changes. 

The bottom panel provides a slider that 
the user can move around to make the PacMen move faster and slower. When 
created, the PacMen first move at a speed of 50.  Dragging the knob to the 
right will make the PacMen grow and shrink and spin faster while dragging 
it to the left will make them slower. Text on the left of the slider will 
state what the speed of the PacMen is at. The minimum speed possible is 1 
while the maximum speed possible is 100.   

1. To open the file from the command line and go directly to a specific line, 
type vim +/LineNumber fileName.
2. syntax off turns off the coloring, syntax on turns it on.
3. Type help.
4. The stack holds the local variables and formal parameters.
5. The only things that can be declared in an interface are public static 
final constants and method headers.
