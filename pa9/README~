CrittersController
This program creates an applet where you can make critters that interact
differently with one another. The applet has three buttons on the top and 
three on the bottom. 
The start button causes the critters (once created) to start moving; if 
the button is clicked and there are less than 2 critters on the canvas, 
the status message will ask the user to make 2 or more critters. If it 
is clicked and there are 2 or more on the canvas, the status says 
"Simulation is running". The stop button freezes them and causes the 
status message to say "Simulation is stopped". The clear button removes 
all critters. 
The Chaser button creates chasers, which are magenta circles that will 
chase other critters except for other Chasers. The Runner button creates 
runners, which are cyan squares that run away from other critters. The 
Random button creates randoms, which are orange plus signs that randomly 
move aroudn the canvas. To actually make the Chaser/Runner/Random, first 
click the button and then click anywhere on the canvas to make the critter 
appear (its center will be where the mouse was clicked). Critters cannot 
move outside the boundaries of the screen.

2. Java abstract class can have method definitions while interfaces cannot. 
Fields in interfaces are automtically public and static and final in 
interfaces but not necessarily in abstract classes.
3. Java abstract classes and interfaces cannot be instantiated and they can 
have method headers.
